Almost two months have passed since SatDump 1.0.3 was released. A lot has changed since then - new features have been added and numerous bugs were squished!
That's why we decided to finally release SatDump version 1.1.0.

# Why 1.1.0?

Back when we started SatDump we've decided to use a versioning system that actually means something. You might be wondering, how does it work? Why is it possible to get 1.1.0 and up before they are released?

## How does it work?
It's actually rather simple: the version naming convention is `vX.Y.Z-commithash`, where:
+ change in `X` means a complete break in compatibility between versions, or a massive development step (like the 0.0.39 => 1.0.0 update involved the change of pretty much all of the code)
+ change in `Y` means partial compatibility changes, but ones that could break backward support. In this release we've changed the product generation and handling substantially to account for things like calibration, which means that **products generated in â‰¤ 1.0.3 may not work in 1.1.0 and vice versa**.
+ change in `Z` is the "normal" small updates, that do not substantially influence compatibility.
+ `commithash` is only visible on pre-release builds (or builds from source). It is the ID of the commit on which the build was compiled. It's a useful tool for debugging and changes with every small change in code

## When are versions changed?
All commits following the release are counted as the next version (except rare instances when a crucial bugfix is released, when the release might get updated), which is why for a while it was possible to get v1.0.4 or v1.1.0 (which has only been released when this post is live).

# Added features

## LUA support

We've decided that it's about time we add some scripting capabilities to SatDump. We chose LUA for this purpose - it's versatile, easy to use and fast when compiled using LUAjit.

But... what is the scripting about!?

## Calibration

Calibration has been a hot topic for a while in SatDump's backstage. For a long time we were debating the best way to handle all the different instruments we support and plan to add in the future, while still keeping it simple and as fast and efficient as possible.
We've come up with a system that utilizes both C++ and LUA giving us optimal performance paired with ease of use (for users *and* developers!).

But what does that mean in practice? SatDump now can generate level 1b products for selected instruments (for now these include AVHRR and MHS, but other instruments such as AMSU-A or HIRS are WIP). Put differently: SatDump can now display radiance (and brightness temperature, or %Albedo for VIS channels) from instruments that have been calibrated.
This is a big deal as raw counts from these instruments are not linear to temperature or even albedo (in case of AVHRR which uses a dual-gain setup).

## LUA composites

Calibration is not the only feature that uses the new possibilities LUA gives. We've realized that the simple equation-based composite system can be very limmiting at times as it only has access to a single pixel at a time. This is solved by giving the user the ability to write their own processing code in LUA. To make it faster we made sure to bind all of the image processing functions from satdump. Note that this is much more complicated and involved than the old system, thus it is not reccomended for simple tasks and new users.

## APT cloud underlay (LUA based)

After APT decoding was introduced in version 1.0.3, the option to underlay created images with a RGB map was added, allowing for stunning APT composite images!
SatDump now also supports a lot more filenames that are used for map overlay and composite images, increasing compatibility with third party software.

## CCSDS LDPC Decoding 

Support for CCSS LDPC codes was finally added, allowing to decode Orion, LandSat-9 and other satellites utilizing the standards.

## TUBIN X-Band decoding

Thanks to a recording by Fred Jansen, it was finally possible to develop a decoder for TU Berlin's TUBIN satellite. 
It was launched in 2021 with the primary mission of monitoring wildfires.
TUBIN takes images of the earth in the visible spectrum with a resolution of 40m/px aswell as thermal images with 170m/px.

## INMARSAT STD-C

INMARSAT STD-C message decoding was added! The INMARSAT network provides ship-to-shore communication and transmits warnings for weather or other emergencies via its EGC channels.
All of which can be decoded by SatDump now. The decoded frames can be sent out via UDP to third-party software.

## INMARSAT AERO

INMARSAT AERO for 0.6k, 1.2k and 10.5kBaud downlinks was added. It can already parse ACARS messages, but since it is not fully done yet, still WIP.

## Decimation

One of the more frequently requested features was the decimation option. That's why we are happy to announce: That's a thing now!
Decimation can be used to artificially lower the samplerate of a SDR, saving a lot of space during baseband recording and processing power.
The decimation feature can be found in the "recorder" tab, directly under the device selection box.

## PROBA-V GPS

Apart from the vegetation images that were added in a previous release, we noticed that the PROBA-V downlink also appears to contain GPS information.
SatDump dumps these GPS-logs to a file now.

## Aaronia SPECTRAN support

Many thanks to Aaronia AG for donating a SPECTRAN V6 Spectrum analyzer with a whopping 245MHz of bandwidth! 
It is now fully supported by SatDump, making recording of very wideband satellites like LandSat possible.

[Add full spectrum image here]

## SDPSK demodulation

SatDump now supports SDPSK demodulation. This allows to decode downlinks like INMARSAT AERO in the near future.


# Bugs fixed

## Fixed METEOR timestamps

MSU-MR images from METEOR showed up in completely wrong locations due to the timestamps being parsed wrong. This is fixed now.

## Don't crash on non-correctable images

When the user tried to correct a non-correctable image, SatDump crashed. That doesn't happen anymore.

## Fixed random crashes

A memory leak caused random crashes. Its not leaking anymore, and sat dump should work a lot more consistent now.

## Don't crash when doing two things at once

A small issue with a mutex has caused sat dump to crash when attempting to do two things at once.

## Fix FFT bug

A small bug in the FFT code sometimes caused SatDump to write FFT beyond its allowed space, causing random crashes.

## Fix SDR++ Server segfaulting on exit

When using a SDR++ Server as a file source, SatDump segfaulted when trying to exit it.

## Fix Waterfall scaling when live processing

## Improve the resampled


# Others

## New composites by @RAD750

AMSU equivalents for MTVZA were added. The snow enhancement has received Geo-correction. 
NDVI and natural color enhancements were fixed. Thanks!

## Fixed projections

Enabled projections for NOAA-DSB HIRS images and retuned FengYun MERSI & NOAA-18 AVHRR projections.

## Performance stuff

CCSDS decoding has been made lighter and the DSP has been cleaned up.
Correlation can now be handled by the GPU. All in all SatDump should work a lot smoother now.

## UI changes

The Viewer and Recorder UI's have been rewriten using ImGui's native elements making it more stable and predictable (after some weird behavior when floating windows were introduced).

## Windows issues

Since 1.0.3 was released we had to fix windows-specific issues almost 10 times (by the time this post is public, probably over that). That is over 3% of all commits after the release. If you experience any weird behavior when using SatDump on Windows OS, **please let us know**. Most of the develpoment is done under linux, so some issues with windows sometimes behaving differently are hard to spot.
