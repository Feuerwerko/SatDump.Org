Almost two months have passed since satDump 1.0.3 was released. A lot has changed since then - new features have been added and numerous bugs were squished!
That's why we decided to finally release satDump version 1.1.0.

# Added features

## CCSDS LDPC Decoding 

Support for CCSS LDPC codes was finally added, allowing to decode Orion, LandSat-9 and other satellites utilizing the standards.

## TUBIN X-Band decoding

Thanks to a recording by Fred Jansen, it was finally possible to develop a decoder for TU Berlin's TUBIN satellite. 
It was launched in 2021 with the primary mission of monitoring wildfires.
TUBIN takes images of the earth in the visible spectrum with a resolution of 40m/px aswell as thermal images with 170m/px.

## INMARSAT STD-C

INMARSAT STD-C message decoding was added! The INMARSAT network provides ship-to-shore communication and transmits warnings for weather or other emergencies via its EGC channels.
All of which can be decoded by satDump now. The decoded frames can be sent out via UDP to third-party software.

## Calibration (by Zbychu)

Zbychu has been hard at work adding calibration for MHS and AVHRR instruments. This allows to get accurate numerical readings from received images, making them usable for further scientific products.
The calibration feature can be found under the "viewer" tab in satDump.

## Decimation

One of the more frequently requested features was the decimation option. That's why we are happy to announce: That's a thing now!
Decimation can be used to artificially lower the samplerate of a SDR, saving a lot of space during baseband recording and processing power.
The decimation feature can be found in the "recorder" tab, directly under the devide selection-selection box.

## APT composites

After APT decoding was introduced in version 1.0.3, the option to underlay created images with a RGB map was added, allowing for stunning APT composite images!
SatDump now also supports a lot more filenames that are used for map overlay and composite images, increasing compatibility with third party software.

## PROBA-V GPS

Apart from the vegetation images that were added in a previous release, we noticed that the PROBA-V downlink also appears to contain GPS information.
SatDump dumps these GPS-locks to a file now.

## Aaronia SPECTRAN support

Many thanks to Aaronia AG for donating a SPECTRAN V6 Spectrum analyzer with a whopping 245MHz of bandwidth! 
It is now fully supported by satDump, making recording of very wideband satellites like LandSat possible.

## SDPSK demodulation

SatDump now supports SDPSK demodulation. This allows to decode downlinks like INMARSAT AERO in the near future.


# Bugs fixed

## Fixed METEOR timestamps

MSU-MR images from METEOR showed up in completely wrong locations due to the timestamps being parsed wrong. This is fixed now.

## Don't crash on non-correctable images

When the user tried to correct a non-correctable image, satDump crashed. That doesn't happen anymore.

## Fixed random crashes

A memory leak caused random crashes. Its not leaking anymore, and sat dump should work a lot more consistent now.

## Don't crash when doing two things at once

A small issue with a mutex has caused sat dump to crash when attempting to do two things at once.

## Fix FFT bug

A small bug in the FFT code sometimes caused satDump to write FFT beyond its allowed space, causing random crashes.

## Fix SDR++ Server segfaulting on exit

When using a SDR++ Server as a file source, satDump segfaulted when trying to exit it.

## Fix Waterfall scaling when live processing

## Improve the resampled


# Others

## New composites by @RAD750

AMSU equivalents for MTVZA were added. The snow enhancement has received Geo-correction. 
NDVI and natural color enhancements were fixed. Thanks!

## Fixed projections

Enabled projections for NOAA-DSB HIRS images and retuned FengYun MERSI & NOAA-18 AVHRR projections.

## Performance stuff

CCSDS decoding has been made lighter and the DSP has been cleaned up.
Correlation can now be handled by the GPU. All in all satDump should work a lot smoother now.
